        <h1><a name="kanchor100"></a>How can Aspen IQmodel Improve Process Management?</h1>
        <p>Process manufacturing managers and engineers continually strive to improve product quality; their challenge is to achieve this goal while also reducing production costs.</p>
        <p>In order to maximize the return on investment in plant and equipment, and to effect product grade transitions efficiently and at minimum cost, it is important that all critical process relationships be identified and key process and product property values be monitored so that any necessary corrective actions can be taken in a timely fashion.</p>
        <p>To support these objectives, Aspen IQmodel offers the means to develop and deploy sophisticated neural network-based models of key process variables and product properties. After a model has been built and validated offline using Aspen IQmodel, it can be deployed in an online environment as a replacement for a hardware analyzer or sparse laboratory data samples, or as a robust mechanism for ensuring the validity of data supplied by a plant DCS. This results in more timely process information and thus more responsive and effective process monitoring and control.</p>
        <p>In addition, as a key component of the Aspen Inferential Qualities (Aspen IQ) product family, Aspen IQmodel can be directly integrated with other AspenTech products and services to provide a comprehensive and fully integrated process manufacturing monitoring, optimization, and control system.</p>
