        <h1><a name="kanchor334"></a>Building Models with Aspen IQmodel</h1>
        <p>Aspen IQmodel provides a comprehensive set of capabilities and features that support building robust sensor validation and/or inferential sensing empirical models derived from plant data.</p>
        <p>For models built using IQmodel, it is also important to ensure that model training data in fact accurately reflect the target process over the operating range expected when the model is deployed online. In practical terms, this means ensuring that the model is trained with a span of data sufficiently long that all normal operating conditions, including acceptable extremes, are included. The perceived quality of input data should also be reflected in the limits used to identify abnormal data values.</p>
        <p>When you wish to build a sensor validation models, the recommended approach is to first build an inferential sensor model to identify which sensors are most important for the inferential model. Then, concentrate on building a good sensor validation model for each of the important physical sensors used by the inferential sensor model. The goal is to build a sensor validation model that has good identifiability for the physical sensor of interest.</p>
        <p>To judge whether or not a sensor validation model has good identifiability:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Examine the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Structured Residual Transforms <span style="font-weight: normal;">|</span></span> <a href="model_grid_views.htm#SR_Transforms_Sensor_Values"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sensor Values</span></a> grid. This matrix maps sensor values to normalized structured residual values, which have an expected value of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The diagonal of this matrix contains values close to zero that reflect the insensitivity of each transform to its corresponding sensor.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Examine the column corresponding to the sensor you are most interested in identifying. If all the elements of the column (other than the diagonal element) are large (for example, greater than 3), then there should be good identifiability. In general, the larger the value of the smallest (non-diagonal) element in the column, the better the identifiablity. Conversely, if any of the non-diagonal elements in the column are less than 1, you should try removing some of the physical sensors (tags) from the model in order to improve identifiablity.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Once you think you have constructed a good sensor validation model, test it in <span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Run</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Mode</span> by inducing artificial faults. A model that exhibits good identifiability should be capable of detecting even small faults.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>If a supposedly good model fails to detect drift, bias, or complete failure, look at the <a href="model_graph_views.htm#The_Structured_Residuals_Graph"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Structured Residuals</span></a> graph. During the fault, the structured residual for the bad sensor should be less than its threshold, while all other sensors should be above their thresholds. If necessary, adjust the identification confidence percentage in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Expert</span> dialog to increase or decrease the threshold. Similar comments apply to the <a href="model_graph_views.htm#The_Generalized_Likelihood_Ratio_Graph"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Generalized Likelihood Ratio</span></a> graph. For precision loss faults, look at the <a href="model_graph_views.htm#The_Normalized_Cumulative_Variance_Graph"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Normalized Cumulative Variance</span></a> graph.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="subheading">Model Building Process</p>
        <p>Although the model building process is generally performed interactively by sequentially executing action steps represented by boxes in the IQmodel <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commands</span> window illustrated below, IQmodel supports batch processing of the three steps that comprise identifying the structure of an inferential sensing model.</p>

        <p class="subheading"><a name="kanchor335"></a>Model Identification Batch Processing</p>
        <p>When the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Batch</span> option is selected, as illustrated below, the dialog boxes for each of the Model Identification steps can be opened, parameters set, and then closed, without causing IQmodel to perform any processing.</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="image\iqbatch.gif" border="0" height="131" src="../image/iqbatch.gif" title="image\iqbatch.gif" width="447" />
        </p>
        <p>After all needed parameters for all Model Identification steps have been set, clicking the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Run Batch</span> button causes IQmodel to perform, in sequence, the calculations for each step and to pass relevant results to the next step. For large models that use genetic algorithm search strategies, it is usually more efficient to set the parameters for all steps before beginning execution, since the genetic algorithm is computationally intensive and can take some time to complete.</p>
        <p class="subheading"><a name="kanchor336"></a>Canceling and Restarting IQmodel Search Calculations</p>
        <p>If search strategy computations for any of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Model Identification</span> steps are interrupted (i.e., the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel</span> button on the associated progress dialog is clicked), IQmodel retains the state of the computation. When the model is saved, the state information is also stored in the model file. If IQmodel is terminated then restarted at a later time, the model can be loaded, the appropriate <span style="font-weight: bold;">Model Identification</span> dialog opened, and search calculations restarted at the point where they were originally interrupted. If stored state information is available in a model, clicking the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Search</span> button in the relevant <span style="font-weight: bold;">Model Identification</span> dialog will bring up a pop-up message box. Options in the pop-up message box allow the user to specify either that search calculations should start over, or that calculations should resume based on state information saved with the model.</p>
        <p>After models have been built and trained, further offline analysis and tuning can be performed using datasets other than the original training dataset. Through <span style="font-weight: bold;">Expert Parameters</span> dialogs associated with every major model building step, parameters that govern the basic structure and features of the current model can be adjusted. As each model building step is completed, a variety of grid and graphical views is provided to permit quick visual assessments of model output resulting from actions at the step.</p>
        <p>Finally, when model characteristics and performance are judged to completely and accurately reflect the process being modeled, IQmodel can export a model file specifically designed for online deployment through other members of the Aspen IQ product family.</p>
