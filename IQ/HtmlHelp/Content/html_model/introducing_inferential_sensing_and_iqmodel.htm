        <h1><a name="kanchor224"></a>Introducing Aspen IQmodel</h1>
        <p>This section contains a brief overview of inferential sensing, sensor validation, and the technical foundation of Aspen IQmodel. Topics covered include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Factors that motivate the use of inferential sensing and sensor validation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A brief description of Aspen IQmodel features and capabilities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>An overview of the Aspen IQmodel software architecture and how Aspen IQmodel components integrate with other AspenTech products to deliver the True Potentialâ„¢ of a process manufacturing enterprise.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Along with the increased complexity of modern process manufacturing comes a corresponding rise in the breadth and depth of problems associated with acquiring and manipulating the real-time data needed to implement comprehensive optimization and control strategies.</p>
        <p>A number of practical engineering issues, such as identifying and installing appropriate sensors, dealing with material toxicity or corrosiveness, or compensating for pressure or temperature extremes, in addition to the nonlinear nature of many processes, conspire to restrict the availability of accurate and timely plant information.</p>
        <p>In the process industries, key product properties often cannot be directly measured, or can only be measured over time periods that result in substantial delays between the time of measurement and the determination of the desired property value. By the time the value is communicated to operators, overall process characteristics may have changed considerably. A response appropriate at the time the measurement was taken may in fact be inappropriate when the property value finally becomes available.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, to avoid expensive and time consuming plant shutdowns due to bad data, it is critical to rapidly and accurately detect, identify, classify, and, when appropriate, replace abnormal data supplied by plant instrumentation. The potential for adverse consequences due to delayed or bad property data is of particular concern during product grade transitions, and serves to underscore the need to continuously monitor all key process variables and to account for both nonlinear as well as linear process dynamics. The concepts of inferential sensing and sensor validation directly address these important issues.</p>
